# FPGA_Lab1 (Vasanthavel Jeeva Kumararaja)
Lab 1 is focused on designing and implementing an 8 to 1 mux using the Vivado software and Xilinx FPGA board. In order to do this we were tasked with designing 3 types of modeling: Structural, Behavioral and Dataflow. Utilizing our knowledge of muxes as well as a truth table and block diagram we could visualize and conceptualize the design of our 8:1 mux. 

**Instructions:**
1) Open Vivado software and create new project
2) Create and implement source files and testbenches for all 3 modelings and run the simulations
3) Once simulation is complete you will be able to see the waveforms
4) Then create the constraints file (XDC) and map the physical pins to your inputs, select lines and ouput
6) Now you can run compilation, synthesis, implementation and generating bit stream.
7) Make sure to  analyze area utilization for each model
8) Finally test your FPGA board with the correct pins
